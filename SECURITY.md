## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

## Security Challenge

This repository serves as a template for understanding Solana security vulnerabilities.
Each example pair demonstrates a common pitfall ("Vulnerable") and its remediation ("Secure").
